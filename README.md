# cloth simulation algorithm reproduction



### Introduction

​	This repository is my own study  and research work about physical simulation knowledges. Mainly about cloth simulation I reproduced using different tools.

 

### Project

```shell
.
├─ basic # basic square cloth mesh created and basic simulation methods
├─ PBD # Position-based Dynamics 
├─ FEM # finite Element Methods
├─ self-collision # basic simulation methods add self-collision
├─ MPM # Using MPM methods to achieve cloth simulation
```
